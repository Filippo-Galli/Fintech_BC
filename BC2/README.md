# Business Case 2: Estimating Client Needs

This folder contains the second business case of the FinTech course, focused on estimating the financial needs of bank clients using predictive modeling and data analysis. The objective is to leverage client data to anticipate product needs and improve personalized banking services.

## Contents

- **notebook_slides/**: Jupyter notebooks and slides for the analysis:
  - `easy_models.ipynb`: Baseline and simple models for estimating client needs.
  - `EstimatingNeedsPoliMI.ipynb`: Main notebook for data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
  - `Zenti_Business_Case_2.pdf`: Business case description and requirements.
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used in this case:
  - `Dataset2_Needs.xls`: Main dataset with client features and target variables.

## How to Use
1. Open `EstimatingNeedsPoliMI.ipynb` to follow the step-by-step analysis and modeling process.
2. Explore `easy_models.ipynb` for baseline approaches.
3. Refer to the `data/` folder for the dataset and to the PDF for business case details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
