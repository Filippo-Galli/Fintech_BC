# Business Case 3: Portfolio Replica Strategy

This folder contains the third business case of the FinTech course, focused on developing and evaluating portfolio replication strategies. The objective is to use quantitative models to replicate benchmark portfolios and assess their performance using real financial data.

## Contents

- **custom_model_Pippo.ipynb**: Custom modeling approach for portfolio replication.
- **custom_model_Tia.ipynb**: Alternative custom model for portfolio strategy.
- **notebook_slides/**: Jupyter notebooks and slides for analysis:
  - `Portfolio_ReplicaPoliMIv2.ipynb`: Main notebook for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
  - `Zenti_Business_Case_3.pdf`: Business case description and requirements.
- **data/**: Contains datasets used in this case:
  - `Dataset3_PortfolioReplicaStrategy.xlsx`: Main dataset for portfolio replication.
  - `Dataset3_PortfolioReplicaStrategyErrataCorrige.xlsx`: Corrected dataset version.

## How to Use
1. Open `Portfolio_ReplicaPoliMIv2.ipynb` in the `notebook_slides/` folder to follow the main analysis and modeling process.
2. Explore `custom_model_Pippo.ipynb` and `custom_model_Tia.ipynb` for alternative modeling approaches.
3. Refer to the `data/` folder for datasets and to the PDF for business case details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Highlights
- Quantitative modeling for portfolio replication.
- Evaluation of model performance using real-world financial data.
- Comparison of different custom modeling approaches.
