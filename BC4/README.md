# Business Case 4: Early Warning System (EWS)

This folder contains the fourth business case of the FinTech course, focused on developing Early Warning Systems (EWS) for financial risk detection. The objective is to use advanced machine learning and deep learning models to identify early signs of financial distress or market anomalies using real-world data.

## Contents

- **custom_model.ipynb**: Custom modeling approach for EWS.
- **DL_custom_model.ipynb**: Deep learning models for early warning system development and evaluation.
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used in this case:
  - `Dataset4_EWS.xlsx`: Main dataset with financial indicators and risk labels.
- **notes_notebooks/**: Supplementary notebooks and documentation:
  - `EarlyWarningSystemPoliMI.ipynb`: Main notebook for EWS analysis and modeling.
  - `Zenti_Business_Case_4.pdf`: Business case description and requirements.

## How to Use
1. Open `EarlyWarningSystemPoliMI.ipynb` in the `notes_notebooks/` folder to follow the main EWS analysis and modeling process.
2. Explore `custom_model.ipynb` and `DL_custom_model.ipynb` for custom and deep learning approaches.
3. Refer to the `data/` folder for datasets and to the PDF for business case details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras, pytorch, etc.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Highlights
- Machine learning and deep learning for early warning risk detection.
- Real-world financial data and practical risk modeling.
- Modular code for experimentation and extension.
