# Business Case 1: Bank Client Segmentation

This folder contains the first business case of the FinTech course, focused on segmenting bank clients using clustering and advanced distance metrics. The goal is to identify meaningful client groups to support targeted marketing and personalized banking services.

## Contents

- **main.ipynb**: Main notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and client segmentation analysis.
- **Custom_distance.ipynb**: Notebook implementing custom distance metrics (e.g., Gower distance) for clustering mixed-type data.
- **data/**: Contains the datasets and metadata used in this case:
  - `BankClients_Metadata.xlsx`: Metadata describing the features in the dataset.
  - `Dataset1_BankClients.xlsx`: Main dataset with client information.
  - `SegmentingClientsPoliMI.ipynb`: Additional notebook for segmentation analysis.
- **notes/**: Supplementary notebooks and documentation:
  - `SegmentingClientsPoliMI.ipynb`: Alternative segmentation approaches.
  - `Updating_PersonasPoliMI.ipynb`: Notes on updating client personas.
  - `Zenti_Business_Case_1.pdf`: Business case description and requirements.

## How to Use
1. Open `main.ipynb` to follow the step-by-step segmentation process.
2. Explore `Custom_distance.ipynb` for custom distance metric implementations.
3. Refer to the `data/` and `notes/` folders for datasets, metadata, and additional documentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Highlights
- Application of clustering algorithms to real-world banking data.
- Use of custom distance metrics for mixed-type features.
- Practical insights for client segmentation and persona development.
