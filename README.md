# FinTech Business Cases & Final Project

Welcome to the FinTech repository! This collection contains a series of business case studies and a final project, developed as part of a FinTech course. Each section explores real-world financial datasets and applies advanced analytics, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to solve practical problems in banking and finance.

## Repository Structure

- **BC1/** – **Business Case 1: Bank Client Segmentation**
  - `main.ipynb`, `Custom_distance.ipynb`: Notebooks for client segmentation using custom distance metrics and clustering.
  - `data/`: Contains metadata and datasets for bank clients.
  - `notes/`: Additional notebooks and documentation.

- **BC2/** – **Business Case 2: Estimating Client Needs**
  - `notebook_slides/`: Notebooks and slides for modeling and estimating client needs.
  - `data/`: Dataset for client needs analysis.

- **BC3/** – **Business Case 3: Portfolio Replica Strategy**
  - `custom_model_Pippo.ipynb`, `custom_model_Tia.ipynb`: Custom modeling approaches for portfolio replication.
  - `notebook_slides/`: Notebooks and slides for portfolio strategies.
  - `data/`: Datasets for portfolio analysis.

- **BC4/** – **Business Case 4: Early Warning System (EWS)**
  - `DL_custom_model.ipynb`: Deep learning models for early warning systems.
  - `notes_notebooks/`: Notebooks and documentation for EWS.
  - `data/`: EWS datasets.

- **Final_project/** – **Final Project: Advanced Anomaly Detection in Finance**
  - `anoGAN.ipynb`, `Autoencoder.ipynb`, `BNN.ipynb`, `LSTM.ipynb`, `baseline models.ipynb`: Notebooks implementing various deep learning models (GANs, Autoencoders, Bayesian Neural Networks, LSTMs) for anomaly detection and time series analysis.
  - `data/`: Datasets for the final project.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Notebooks:** Each business case and the final project contain Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis, code, and results.
2. **Datasets:** All required datasets are included in the respective `data/` folders.
3. **Documentation:** Additional notes and slides are provided for deeper understanding and context.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras, pytorch, etc.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
